# Lane 3 - distributed (branch `lane/distributed`)

See `CLAUDE.md`, "Third and fourth lanes". Moved here from `STATUS.md` stage 3 on 2026-10-28 (maintainer).

## Next steps

D1. ~~**Item 18 step 2 - distributed complete mode.**~~ *Done 2026-10-28 (738d1e7, see Log).* Opt-in `distributedComplete`
    (default false). Open follow-ups, folded into D2: (a) TLS + a real auth provider between two processes (the
    internal identity is unit-tested; the in-process test runs without auth); (b) peer streams are read one after the
    other by DuckDB's scan (all DoGets start at once, gRPC buffers the rest) - measure in D2 whether a parallel
    prefetch is worth it; (c) failover to an endpoint's backup location instead of the single-node fallback.
D2. Item 18 step 3 - cluster integration test (3 nodes in CI, answers = single-node answers, TPC-H shapes that merge;
    peer killed before / during the stream), then a perf test: heavy JDBC queries on 3 nodes on vs off.
D3. Faster detection of a crashed member (`STATUS.md` Open question, item 0d follow-up): plan from a local cluster snapshot
    refreshed by the heartbeat thread instead of blocking map reads; keep `hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds` as is.

## Log

- 2026-10-28 (maintainer): lane created; D1-D3.
- 2026-10-28 (lane 3 session): D1 done - item 18 step 2 (738d1e7, branch `lane/distributed`, rebase-merged into `main`).
  `DistributedComplete`: on the planning node's complete-answer DoGet, mergeable shapes (`CompleteAnswerMerge.refusal`
  == null, no parameters, no time travel) with >= 2 planned partial endpoints are read from the endpoints' first
  locations (DoGet with header `x-kestrel-internal-identity` = user + expiry + HMAC-SHA256 with the ticket secret,
  60 s), concatenated into one Arrow stream registered in the node's DuckDB and merged; the merged columns are renamed
  to the single-node answer's names (found by the test: partial endpoints name `count(*)`, the complete path
  `count_star()`) and the types checked before the client's stream starts (start is deferred to the first batch, so
  any failure before it falls back cleanly). Peers: `InternalCallAuthenticator` wraps the configured authenticator,
  a gRPC interceptor refuses the header from addresses that are not live members' hosts; peer TLS trust
  `distributedCompleteTrustedCertificates`, else `FLIGHT_TLS_CERT`. Tests: `DistributedCompleteIntegrationTest`
  (one node, 4 files, `endpointsPerServer=4`: 7 shapes identical schema + rows on vs off, 2 refused shapes untouched,
  unreachable peer -> fallback), `InternalCallIdentityTest`, `InternalCallAuthenticatorTest`, `ConfigAdapterTest`.
  CI run 40670031954 green on the branch; package run 40671772031 on 738d1e7 was cancelled by the plugins lane's push; their package dispatch 40672085389 on c258adf contains 738d1e7 and was running at session end (its pre-release server-1.0.0-c258adf27dc9 carries this change - next session: confirm it is green, else dispatch package=true). Next: D2 (3-node CI test).
